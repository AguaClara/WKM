              determine an optimal G value. Additionally, the team seeks to evaluate the use
              of hydrophobic tubing to minimize headloss, assess whether headloss can be mitigated
              through a sudden, short increase in pump speed, and to determine a relationship between
              coagulant dose and optimal G. </p>

    <h2 class="blue" id="LR_team3">High Rate Sedimentation </h2>
    <div class="LR_team_container" id="LR_team_container3">
      <div class="LR_txt">
        <p> Sedimentation is a critical process for water treatment plants.
          It is the process by which coagulated minerals, dirt, clay, and other particles
          are removed from the water via gravitational settling. In a sedimentation tank,
          water flows upward as flocs settle downward. The particles settle into a "floc blanket" -
          a fluidized bed of suspended solids colliding in a bottom zone of the sedimentation tank.
          The particles are initially light and small, but as coagulant dosage persists and particles
          continue to collide, the particles clump together into heavier floc that will settle into
          the basin of the recirculator. This process permits clearer water to continue up the plate settler,
          resulting in a lower effluent NTU (Nephelometric Turbidity Unit, a measure of clarity).
          Past High Rate Sedimentation (HRS) teams have hypothesized that floc blankets
          thin as experiments progress due to coagulant sticking to the walls of the flocculator,
          reducing the overall coagulant dosage. </p>
        <p> The Spring 2018 team conducted experiments that
          found increasing coagulant dosage did not prevent floc blanket thinning. The team also
          found that increasing tube settler length and reducing flocculator shear had minimal
          effects on floc blanket thinning.</p>

      <div class="LR_txt">
        <p> Research the theories of how clay particles are filtered within the stacked
          rapid sand filters at the microscopic level by using a flow cell to model clay-sand
          interactions at constrictions between sand particles. This semester's Filter Constrictions
          team worked on improving the model of particle deposition at a flow constriction
          and the imaging of said model. This required the adjustment of the flow cell geometry,
          system flow, and video equipment. Changes made to the model and schematic improved imaging,
          and the videos the team captured during the experiments supported the hypothesis that flocs
          are preferentially caught at constrictions in filters.

          where the Fall 2017 team left off and integrating the new chemical dosing system
          into the rest of the plant as well as putting finishing touches to the other parts of the plant.
          The team will be working on performance testing the plant with and without the EStaRS and comparing
          results to further optimize the plant for implementation in Honduras.
