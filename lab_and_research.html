        <p>The C-NARC subteam is investigating how the rate of attachment of coagulant nanoparticles 
          to clay particles and the flocculator walls changes over time. Research conducted by Contact 
          Chamber as well as observations by other teams suggests that the rate of increase of head 
          loss over the length of the flocculator is proportional to the concentration of free coagulant 
          nanoparticles in each section of the flocculator. By measuring head loss through the flocculator, 
          the team hopes to observe a decrease in the rate of head loss accumulation. </p>

      <div class="LR_txt">
        <p> Sedimentation is a critical process for water treatment plants.
            It is the process by which coagulated minerals, dirt, clay, and other particles
            are removed from the water via gravitational settling. In a sedimentation tank,
            water flows upward as flocs settle downward. The particles settle into a "floc blanket" -
            a fluidized bed of suspended solids colliding in a bottom zone of the sedimentation tank.
            The particles are initially light and small, but as coagulant dosage persists and particles
            continue to collide, the particles clump together into heavier floc that will settle into
            the basin of the recirculator. This process permits clearer water to continue up the plate settler,
            resulting in a lower effluent NTU (Nephelometric Turbidity Unit, a measure of clarity).
            Past High Rate Sedimentation (HRS) teams have hypothesized that floc blankets
            thin as experiments progress due to coagulant sticking to the walls of the flocculator,
            reducing the overall coagulant dosage.<p>
            <p> For this semester, the team will be focusing on the redesigning of the input
               of water into the high rate sedimentation tanks. This will include the 3D drawing 
               and printing of the inserts. </p>

          The team is dedicating its time this semester to completing fabrication of the 1 L/s
          plant and combining it with the EStaRS filter. This semester's team is picking up
          where the Fall 2017 team left off and integrating the new chemical dosing system
          into the rest of the plant as well as putting finishing touches to the other parts of the plant.
          The team will be working on performance testing the plant with and without the EStaRS and comparing
          results to further optimize the plant for implementation in Honduras.

          and a large dose of aluminum sulfate, which causes sludge disposal problems. Instead, we 
          use Polyaluminum Chloride (PACl) as a coagulant to which the fluoride can both adsorb to
