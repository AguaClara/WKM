        <p> “Aguaclara has made it clear to me the importance of communication
          and lifelong friendships; that the key to engineering is a foundation
          of understanding across ideologies, languages, and cultures. Rather
          than becoming overwhelmed by the daunting mission that defines Aguaclara,
          being a part of the team has shown me that there is sophistication in simplicity,
          innovation in friendship, and beauty in engineering."
