        <p> “Aguaclara has made it clear to me the importance of communication
          and lifelong friendships; that the key to engineering is a foundation
          of understanding across ideologies, languages, and cultures. Rather
          than becoming overwhelmed by the daunting mission that defines Aguaclara,
          being a part of the team has shown me that there is sophistication in simplicity,
          innovation in friendship, and beauty in engineering."

        <p> “Being surrounded by so many people who are equally committed to using
          engineering to benefit communities is incredible. It has been so special to
          do research, watch the implementation of the team’s hard work, and have the
          opportunity to visit plants in Honduras. AguaClara has inspired a change in
          my career path to focus more on safe water."
