<div class="fabrication_team_container" id="fabrication_team_container1">
  <div class="fabrication_txt">
    <p>Horizontal filtration is a completely new innovation for the AguaClara team, arising
      from a desire to make the 1 L/s plants easier to make and ship by eliminating the
      Enclosed Stacked Rapid Sand Filter. To create a horizontal filter, aspects of the
      sedimentation tanks and current filter design will be used, such as the relationship between
      backwash and operational speed, as well as the design of the plate settlers. Our goals for the
      semester are to begin design and fabrication of a horizontal flow filter. This will involve characterization
      of key parameters, using Fusion360 to make a model of the system, and fabrication of a prototype. </p>

  <div class="fabrication_txt">
    <p>The goal of the Sensor Development subteam is to create sensors that help monitor water quality
       during the water treatment process, for the purpose of improving experimentation in other subteams
       and facilitating the work of plant operators. In particular, the team has been working on a particle
       concentration and turbidity sensor for the last few semesters, beginning with a fluidized bed solids
       detector developed for in-lab use and now a submersible solids detector for field use.
        The submersible solids detector is the main focus for the team this semester.
        Two different designs based on an endoscope and a pre-developed turbidity sensor will be tested
        to measure the height of the sludge blanket in the sedimentation tanks.<p>

<div class="fabrication_team_container" id="fabrication_team_container3">
  <div class="fabrication_txt">
    <p> High Flow Float Valve is a fabrication team that will fabricate a float valve to
      alleviate distribution tank overflow during off-peak hours. The high flow float valve will control
      the flow rate of water into the distribution tank. The distribution tank is the storage tank for clean
      water exiting the treatment plant before it is distributed to the community, and overflows when the tank
       is full. Overflow happens mainly during off-peak hours from midnight to dawn when demand is low.
       Avoiding overflow is desirable because the excess treated drinking water is wasted.
       To avoid the tank overflowing, the float valve will decrease the flow rate as the tank fills up.</p>

  <div class="fabrication_txt">
    <p> The purpose of the Ram Pump team is to design and develop a properly functioning hydraulic ram pump,
      or hydram, for implementation in AguaClara plants. The hydram can be used to deliver water from below
       the facility back to the top for utilization in chemical stock tanks or to collect water at higher
       elevations for alternative uses.<p>
