    <p> The main objective of the Investments Team is to secure donor and investor
      funding in order to aid AguaClara in carrying out its present and future goals.
       The team aims to achieve this through 1) developing an accounting tool which would
       help local communities in Honduras better keep track of their finances and demonstrate
       to investors the financial viability of AguaClara water treatment plants and 2) compiling
       a database of potential donors and investors whose vision aligns with the AguaClara's
       objectives. For this semester, the team's goals were to create a series of educational
      videos of the accounting software QFACWIN and aid AguaClara Reach in compiling a donor database</p>
